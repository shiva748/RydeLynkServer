                  <h4>Introduction</h4>
                  <p>
                    Welcome to our platform. By accessing or using our services,
                    you agree to comply with and be bound by the following terms
                    and conditions. Please read them carefully.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Definitions</h4>
                  <p>
                    - <strong>Client:</strong> A user who posts their taxi
                    service requirements on the platform.<br />
                    - <strong>Service Provider:</strong> A user who posts offers
                    to fulfill the taxi service requirements posted by
                    clients.<br />
                    - <strong>Platform:</strong> The app and related services
                    provided by us.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Nature of the Platform</h4>
                  <p>
                    - The platform is designed to facilitate the exchange of
                    information between clients seeking taxi services and
                    service providers offering such services.<br />
                    - The platform itself does not provide taxi services. It
                    serves solely as a medium for clients and service providers
                    to connect.<br />
                    - Any agreements or transactions for taxi services are made
                    directly between the client and the service provider. The
                    platform does not oversee or guarantee the provision of
                    these services.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Posting Taxi Requirements and Offers</h4>
                  <p>
                    - <strong>Clients:</strong> Clients can post their taxi
                    service requirements on the platform, specifying details
                    such as pickup location, destination, date, time, and any
                    special requirements.<br />
                    - <strong>Service Providers:</strong> Service providers can
                    respond to these posts with their offers, including details
                    such as availability, estimated fare, vehicle type, and any
                    additional services provided.<br />
                    - The platform facilitates the exchange of information but
                    does not guarantee the quality, completion, or legality of
                    the taxi services provided.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Acceptance of Offers</h4>
                  <p>
                    - Clients can review offers from service providers and
                    accept an offer that best suits their needs.<br />
                    - Upon acceptance, the client will receive the service
                    provider's details, including contact information, to
                    proceed with the taxi service arrangement.<br />
                    - The acceptance of an offer on the platform is not a
                    legally binding contract and does not guarantee the
                    completion of the taxi service. It is an indication of
                    intent to engage the service provider.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Transactions and Payments</h4>
                  <p>
                    - Any transaction or payment arrangement is made directly
                    between the client and the service provider.<br />
                    - The platform does not handle payments, process
                    transactions, or hold any responsibility for financial
                    exchanges between clients and service providers.<br />
                    - The accepted offer on the platform does not reflect the
                    final amount to be paid by the client. Clients must collect
                    a bill from the service provider directly to determine the
                    final payment.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Billing</h4>
                  <p>
                    - <strong>Service Providers:</strong> The service provider
                    is responsible for providing a bill to the client for the
                    taxi service rendered. The bill should include all
                    applicable charges, including fares, taxes, and any
                    additional fees.<br />
                    - <strong>Clients:</strong> Clients should ensure they
                    receive a proper bill from the service provider for any
                    completed service.<br />
                    - <strong>Reporting Issues:</strong> If a service provider
                    fails to provide a bill, clients can report the issue to the
                    platform through the designated reporting system. The
                    platform will investigate the matter, gathering relevant
                    information, and take suitable actions, which may include
                    warnings, suspension, or permanent ban of the service
                    provider.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Taxes and Government Compliance</h4>
                  <p>
                    - <strong>Service Providers:</strong> Service providers are
                    solely responsible for determining, collecting, and
                    remitting any applicable taxes to the appropriate government
                    authorities. This includes income tax, sales tax, VAT, or
                    any other applicable taxes.<br />
                    - <strong>Clients:</strong> Clients should be aware that the
                    final amount billed by the service provider may include
                    applicable taxes.<br />
                    - The platform is not responsible for calculating,
                    collecting, or remitting any taxes related to the
                    transactions between clients and service providers.<br />
                    - Both clients and service providers must comply with all
                    applicable laws and regulations, including tax obligations,
                    in their respective jurisdictions.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Operator Wallet</h4>
                  <p>
                    - Operators can top up their wallet to pay Platform fees.
                    The wallet can hold a maximum of INR 2000.<br />
                    - The wallet balance is refundable. Operators must contact
                    support for refund requests.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Limitation of Liability</h4>
                  <p>
                    - The platform is not responsible for any disputes, damages,
                    or claims arising from interactions between clients and
                    service providers.<br />
                    - The platform does not guarantee the accuracy,
                    completeness, or reliability of any information provided by
                    users on the platform.<br />
                    - The platform is not liable for any direct, indirect,
                    incidental, or consequential damages resulting from the use
                    of our services. This includes, but is not limited to,
                    damages for loss of profits, goodwill, data, or other
                    intangible losses.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Dispute Resolution</h4>
                  <p>
                    - Any disputes between clients and service providers should
                    be resolved directly between the parties involved.<br />
                    - The platform may provide assistance in mediating disputes
                    but is not obligated to do so. The platform's role in
                    dispute resolution is limited to facilitating communication
                    and gathering information.<br />
                    - Users agree to attempt to resolve any disputes amicably
                    before seeking formal legal action.
                  </p>
                  <h4>User Responsibilities</h4>
                  <p>
                    - <strong>Accurate Information:</strong> Users must provide
                    accurate and truthful information when creating profiles,

                    misrepresenting services, or engaging in any conduct that
                    could harm other users or the platform.<br />
                    - The platform reserves the right to suspend or terminate
                    accounts that violate these terms and conditions. Violations
                    may include providing false information, failing to provide
                    services as agreed, or engaging in prohibited activities.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Problematic Scenarios</h4>
                  <p>
                    - <strong>Service Failures:</strong> If a service provider
                    fails to fulfill their obligations after an offer has been
                    accepted, clients can report the issue to the platform. The
                    platform will investigate and take appropriate actions,
                    which may include suspending or banning the service
                    provider.<br />
                    - <strong>Fraudulent Activities:</strong> Any user suspected
                    of engaging in fraudulent activities, such as false
                    advertising or misrepresentation, will be subject to account
                    suspension or termination upon verification.<br />
                    - <strong>Disruptive Behavior:</strong> Users engaging in
                    disruptive or abusive behavior towards other users or the

                    user’s account will be terminated.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Changes to Terms and Conditions</h4>
                  <p>
                    - The platform reserves the right to modify these terms and
                    conditions at any time. Any changes will be communicated to
                    users through the platform, and users will be required to
                    review and accept the updated terms.<br />
                    - Users will be notified of any significant changes through

                    conditions.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;- Insurance information<br />
                    -
                    <strong>Responsibility for Drivers and Cabs:</strong>
                    Operators are fully responsible for their drivers and cabs.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;- Vehicles are properly maintained, insured, and

                    perform a verification process to validate the details
                    provided by Operators. However, this verification is limited
